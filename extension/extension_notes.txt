Notes: (understanding the chrome extension environment)
  - Service Workers (background.js is a service worker)
    - A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, 
    opening the door to features that don't need a web page or user interaction.
      - This is the technology that enables native-like experiences such as push notifications, rich offline support, 
      background sync, and "Add to Home Screen" on the open web

    - service workers can't access the DOM directly 
      - thus, use messages if you want to communicate with a content script that can then manipulate the DOM
    - service workers are terminated when not in use and restarted when needed (thus, don't rely on them for global state; 
    use indexedDB, etc. instead)
      - ie. when they are done calling a chrome API, etc.

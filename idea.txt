A: (<— starting here...) 
- “organizing the de-organized web; so much great information but it is so hard to find” 
  (both from passive search and active discovery method) 

- An AI that automatically tracks stuff that you like, whether it be blogs, etc. and starts recommending you articles from those sites, 
or similar articles/domains/people ('discover an interesting website you never knew about')
  - ^ A lot of great information on the web but at the moment, I need to actively find it; there has to exist an AI that finds 
    information for me, based on my search history, daily browsing, bookmarks, etc. 
      - YT recommends videos (although I want to build a better personalized recommendation engine) 
        - ^ Cold start problem can be evaded by using browser history 

- Many additional features can be added beyond the above: 
  - Entity-linking people with all their information on the web (recommendation of people/personal-websites, twitter profiles, etc.)
  - QA on documents, summarization, organization via topics/categories, can provide abstractive overviews of current trends in 
  various topics (to help with information overload problem)
 
(Abstractive thoughts:)
  - It will be like a youtube dashboard but for the whole web (very personalized to you)
  

TODO: For Bookmark Extension
(progress along as we use it more as this will constantly adapt...)
  - Need to add a toggle display for urls or maybe a different UI to better deal with all the urls
    - ^Very soon, there will be a lot here and just having a ton of text as list might not be ideal (will need to experiment)

Possible next steps: (take everything below with a grain of salt) 
- Next thing, add a follow feature for sites; the extension/dashboard will show notifications when new content has been posted on the site
  - ie. extension will have a button that says 'follow site' 
    ^ need to most likely check the type of website before allowing this 
  (An AI assistant that can send notifications is a first ‘good’ step as right now, many rely on emails and emails are 
  obviously a sub-optimal approach)

  - Good digression: 
    - Build a picture extractors (bike pictures) and showing the prices (& having notifications; 
    these same notification-functionality can be abstracted to blogs, etc.); instead of me constantly checking 

- Third thing is, scraping the web from our sites (leveraging history/bookmarks & above code...)
  - Now this web crawler should be 'intelligent' to some degree; ** Web-scraper should be intelligent too! 
    - ^ since we are limited in space, should have prioritization-levels on what we should scrape, etc.         
  - Scraper will allow discovery of new sites / content (recommendation-engine)
    - based on my history, bookmarks (including above), etc.; 
  - Can possibly use this to build a more intelligent/personalized retrieval-engine as well 
    - merger between global & personalized pagerank?
      - how effective would this be? we have the attributes from the extension
      https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/history/#type-TransitionType


^ as mentioned above, this extension won't just be for bookmarks, I think it connects to the abstractive better information 
discovery mechanisms & organization/presentation (latter is a bit less than the former)
  - having an extension column showing them there (possibly leveraging a similar PT-model?) would be interesting

A: (<— starting here...) 
- “organizing the de-organized web; so much great information but it is so hard to find” 
  (both from passive search and active discovery method) 

- An AI that automatically tracks stuff that you like, whether it be blogs, etc. and starts recommending you articles from those sites, 
or similar articles/domains/people ('discover an interesting website you never knew about')
  - ^ A lot of great information on the web but at the moment, I need to actively find it; there has to exist an AI that finds 
    information for me, based on my search history, daily browsing, bookmarks, etc. 
      - YT recommends videos (although I want to build a better personalized recommendation engine) 
        - ^ Cold start problem can be evaded by using browser history 

- Many additional features can be added beyond the above: 
  - Entity-linking people with all their information on the web (recommendation of people/personal-websites, twitter profiles, etc.)
  - QA on documents, summarization, organization via topics/categories, can provide abstractive overviews of current trends in 
  various topics (to help with information overload problem)


^ Domain specificity? 
  - let's start with the generalized approach; 
    - we will probably need to classify by types but no need to premature optimize/think about right now
      - the types will be very useful in specific domain search (ie. only give 'github repos' for following query)
 

Would all these features be part of one extension? (not sure but many would I think 'come back' to a main dashboard)
- First thing I will do is build a quick bookmark feature
  - Extension will save my highlighted text along with domain

(potential but just focus on above; take everything below with a grain of salt) 
- Next thing, add a follow feature for sites; the extension/dashboard will show notifications when new content has been posted on the site
  - ie. extension will have a button that says 'follow site' 
    ^ need to most likely check the type of website before allowing this 
- Third thing is, scraping the web from our sites (leveraging history/bookmarks, etc.)
  - Now this web crawler should be 'intelligent' to some degree; ** Web-scraper should be intelligent too! 
    - ^ since we are limited in space, should have prioritization-levels on what we should scrape, etc.         
  - Scraper will allow discovery of new sites / content (recommendation-engine)
    - based on my history, bookmarks (including above), etc.; 
  - Can possibly use this to build a more intelligent/personalized retrieval-engine as well 
    - merger between global & personalized pagerank?
      - how effective would this be? we have the attributes from the extension
      https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/history/#type-TransitionType


  ^ On our dashboard, for other similar side projects we work on (if they are extensions), the dashboard can have that extensions column 
  showing it...

^ as mentioned above, this extension won't just be for bookmarks, I think that connects to the abstractive better information 
discovery mechanisms & organization/presentation (latter is a bit less than the former)

^ feature for BM is to add automatic grouping by AI 


An AI assistant that can send notifications is a first ‘good’ step as right now, many rely on emails and emails are obviously a sub-optimal approach 


(Abstractive thoughts:)
- It will be like a youtube dashboard but for the whole web (very personalized to you)

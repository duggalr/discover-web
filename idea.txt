A: (<— starting here...) 
- “organizing the de-organized web; so much great information but it is so hard to find” 
  (both from passive search and active discovery method) 
- "A platform for all your information… or rather, information you 'care' about or 'may care about'"

- An AI that automatically tracks stuff that you like, whether it be blogs, etc. and starts recommending you articles from those sites, 
or similar articles/domains/people ('discover an interesting website you never knew about')
  - ^ A lot of great information on the web but at the moment, I need to actively find it; there has to exist an AI that finds 
    information for me, based on my search history, daily browsing, bookmarks, etc. 
      - YT recommends videos (although I want to build a better personalized recommendation engine) 
        - ^ Cold start problem can be evaded by using browser history 

- Many additional features can be added beyond the above: 
  - Entity-linking people with all their information on the web (recommendation of people/personal-websites, twitter profiles, etc.)
  - QA on documents, summarization, organization via topics/categories, can provide abstractive overviews of current trends in 
  various topics (to help with information overload problem)
 
(Abstractive thoughts:)
  - It will be like a youtube dashboard but for the whole web (very personalized to you)
  

TODO: For Bookmark Extension
(progress along as we use it more as this will constantly adapt...)
  - Need to add a toggle display for urls or maybe a different UI to better deal with all the urls
    - ^Very soon, there will be a lot here and just having a ton of text as list might not be ideal (will need to experiment)

Possible next steps: (take everything below with a grain of salt) 
- Next thing, add a follow feature for sites; the extension/dashboard will show notifications when new content has been posted on the site
  - ie. extension will have a button that says 'follow site' 
    ^ need to most likely check the type of website before allowing this 
  (An AI assistant that can send notifications is a first ‘good’ step as right now, many rely on emails and emails are 
  obviously a sub-optimal approach)

  - Good digression: 
    - Build a picture extractors (bike pictures) and showing the prices (& having notifications; 
    these same notification-functionality can be abstracted to blogs, etc.); instead of me constantly checking 

- Third thing is, scraping the web from our sites (leveraging history/bookmarks & above code...)
  - Now this web crawler should be 'intelligent' to some degree; ** Web-scraper should be intelligent too! 
    - ^ since we are limited in space, should have prioritization-levels on what we should scrape, etc.         
  - Scraper will allow discovery of new sites / content (recommendation-engine)
    - based on my history, bookmarks (including above), etc.; 
  - Can possibly use this to build a more intelligent/personalized retrieval-engine as well 
    - merger between global & personalized pagerank?
      - how effective would this be? we have the attributes from the extension
      https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/history/#type-TransitionType


^ as mentioned above, this extension won't just be for bookmarks, I think it connects to the abstractive better information 
discovery mechanisms & organization/presentation (latter is a bit less than the former)
  - having an extension column showing them there (possibly leveraging a similar PT-model?) would be interesting

*Similarity idea is interesting but wouldn't we need types? (to help find/discover stuff on the web that I am interested in)
  - similarity to SO questions or similarity to OS github repo? ie. is there some stuff where similarity doesn't make sense?
    - An AI that can find similar content on the web; 
      ie. My notes about thinking/building, the AI should be able to recommend notes.andymatuschak.org



TODO: think and start below
1. Instead of building a new text-editor for my personal website, I leverage my existing macOS notepad-editor; 
  - I can chose which notes to publish to my personal website? 
    - I feel I can leverage tabFS for something like this? (new interfacilitation between web/OS; much needed!)
    (^the macOS text snippets are shown directly here as well)
      ^ Just use the text folder from tabFS; we can just write the stuff in our notes & simply html converter  
          - ie. '-' into list, bold into 'b', etc

  ^Then, you can have AI learn the notes, sort, recommend, etc. (bunch of experimentation to be done here)
    - Learning my bookmarks, organizing them and recommending other posts, domains?    
      - automatic organization of my snippets by AI? (categorization of topics)
    ^ honestly, follow/similarity can followup right after? 

2. Follow: an AI can follow a particular website for an update (ie. a new blog post) and then, it can let me know 
when a new blog post has been posted 
- Alternative ways to do this: 
    - RSS & Email Newsletter
    - Both I believe are suboptimal, why? 
    (rss, need a reader, every website needs its own rss-feed, old/outdated; newsletter is interesting as it is an automatic 'eventListener'
    with email as the medium. The problem I think is email as the medium; Personally for me, I don’t use it; I end of subscribing to 
    many newsletters only to unsubscribe or lose interest in them; also, never read them… but I may just be lazy; I think you could 
    create intelligent AI-email software but I still think below approach is at least worth a try...)
        - I think ‘scraping’ currently on the web is stupid; It is manual scraping done by the computer but you can have AI-based, 
        ‘smart’ scraping done too? 
            - ie. scrape only for blog posts or only for pictures of a particular kind across many websites
            (much like what Diffbot did to create their knowledge graph)
                - ^ this way, you don’t need to write new code to scrape new websites or new code to 
                interact with different API’s; it is a generalized approach that can get better overtime 
                (possibly some sort of a feedback loop) 
                    - AI can be a ‘listener’, possibly visiting a website periodically every t days 
                    (it can learn to estimate when a new post is likely based on previous posts or if this blog is inactive, etc; 
                    can start with trivial visit a list of sites everyday) 
                    - Price checker is an easy byproduct of ‘follow-generalization’: (Can abstract this to many avenues) 
                        - ie. you could have an AI look at t-shirts of a specific kind or bikes of some kind across various 
                        websites and it will let you know when it has found stuff

                    ^ Twitter is another one (people I am interested in hearing from) but not a big fan of using up to the platform 
                    (primary reason is twitter has a lot of idiots)

A: (<— starting here...) 
- “organizing the de-organized web; so much great information but it is so hard to find” 
  (both from passive search and active discovery method) 
- "A platform for all your information… or rather, information you 'care' about or 'may care about'"

- An AI that automatically tracks stuff that you like, whether it be blogs, etc. and starts recommending you articles from those sites, 
or similar articles/domains/people ('discover an interesting website you never knew about')
  - ^ A lot of great information on the web but at the moment, I need to actively find it; there has to exist an AI that finds 
    information for me, based on my search history, daily browsing, bookmarks, etc. 
      - YT recommends videos (although I want to build a better personalized recommendation engine) 
        - ^ Cold start problem can be evaded by using browser history 

- Many additional features can be added beyond the above: 
  - Entity-linking people with all their information on the web (recommendation of people/personal-websites, twitter profiles, etc.)
  - QA on documents, summarization, organization via topics/categories, can provide abstractive overviews of current trends in 
  various topics (to help with information overload problem)
 
(Abstractive thoughts:)
  - It will be like a youtube dashboard but for the whole web (very personalized to you)

Right now, it's just building out various things but I think these wil all interfacilitate together really soon; 
  - Can't see how this will all come together but I have a feeling there will interfacilitation here...





TODO: 
- Follow: an AI can follow a particular website for an update (ie. a new blog post) and then, it can let me know 
when a new blog post has been posted (start with just blogs)
  - Alternative ways to do this: 
    - RSS & Email Newsletter
    - Both I believe are suboptimal, why? 
    (rss, need a reader, every website needs its own rss-feed, old/outdated; newsletter is interesting as it is an automatic 'eventListener'
    with email as the medium. The problem I think is email as the medium; Personally for me, I don’t use it; I end of subscribing to 
    many newsletters only to unsubscribe or lose interest in them; also, never read them… but I may just be lazy; I think one could 
    create intelligent AI-email software but I still think below approach is at least worth a try...)

^Start with just blogs (have a list of blogs that I would like to follow; ie. right-click extension and "follow website"):
  - The AI should first be able to recognize this is a "personal blogging-type website" and then it should be able to recognize that a 
  new post has arrived; it would be cool if you can also have AI entity link the person who created the website with the site (creating 
  a knowledge graph; but not necessarily an explicit knowledge graph or rather, probably not using explicit knowledge-graph construction
  approaches)
    - Start first with AI being able to extract the blog-posts (not classification of website)
      - ie. give it balaji's site, it should be able to extract all posts, with their title's, article, date, etc. 
        - ^essentially just a "smart or more generalized scraper" rather than using rules...

  - **Good digression: 
    - Build a picture extractors (bike pictures) using above approach and showing the prices (& having notifications using above); 
      - Better than me having to constantly check and it's a waste of time to check in various sites, etc. 


Bookmarks TODO: 
  - Need to add search on my text snippets 
    - need an AI to organize my text snippets (grouping? experiment here)
  - Add hostname text-snippet toggle 

Related:
  Then, you can have AI learn the notes, sort, recommend, etc. (bunch of experimentation to be done here)
    - Learning my bookmarks, organizing them and recommending other posts, domains?    
      - automatic organization of my snippets by AI? (categorization of topics)
    ^ honestly, follow/similarity can followup right after? 
    - The AI can learn from all my personal-data (that I choose to give it) for recommendations, retrieval, etc. 

  *Similarity idea is interesting but wouldn't we need types? (to help find/discover stuff on the web that I am interested in)
    - similarity to SO questions or similarity to OS github repo? ie. is there some stuff where similarity doesn't make sense?
      - An AI that can find similar content on the web; 
        ie. My notes about thinking/building, the AI should be able to recommend the notes from notes.andymatuschak.org

  *Dependent on project I am working on, the AI can recommend me the books, people, retrieval links, etc. that way?

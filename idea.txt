A: (<— starting here...) 
- “organizing the de-organized web; so much great information but it is so hard to find” 
  (both from passive search and active discovery method) 
- "A platform for all your information… or rather, information you 'care' about or 'may care about'"

- An AI that automatically tracks stuff that you like, whether it be blogs, etc. and starts recommending you articles from those sites, 
or similar articles/domains/people ('discover an interesting website you never knew about')
  - ^ A lot of great information on the web but at the moment, I need to actively find it; there has to exist an AI that finds 
    information for me, based on my search history, daily browsing, bookmarks, etc. 
      - YT recommends videos (although I want to build a better personalized recommendation engine) 
        - ^ Cold start problem can be evaded by using browser history 

- Many additional features can be added beyond the above: 
  - Entity-linking people with all their information on the web (recommendation of people/personal-websites, twitter profiles, etc.)
  - QA on documents, summarization, organization via topics/categories, can provide abstractive overviews of current trends in 
  various topics (to help with information overload problem)
 
(Abstractive thoughts:)
  - It will be like a youtube dashboard but for the whole web (very personalized to you)

Right now, it's just building out various things but I think these wil all interfacilitate together really soon; 
  - Can't see how this will all come together but I have a feeling there will be interfacilitation here... (even with OS/Web)


Thoughts/Stuff to explore: 

  - Following when a website uploads a new blog post 
    - RSS, Email Newsletter 
    (^above is far from ideal --> look at rss_script.py)
  
  - Recommendation: 
    - With my current bookmark extension, just using that to start recommending me other content from those domains based on
    content that I saved; 
      - We can then start recommending other similar content from websites we have not yet seen (from bookmark snippets)    
    - An AI that automatically tracks stuff that you like, whether it be blogs, etc. and starts recommending you articles from those sites, or similar domains/people 
      - ^A lot of great information on the web but at the moment, I need to actively find it; there has to exist an AI that finds information for me, based on my search history, daily browsing, bookmarks, etc. 
        - YT recommends videos (although I want to build a much better personalized recommendation engine) 

    ^ ie. it would be really good if AI recommended me talks of consciousness (whether interviews by Lex) or other
    similar papers (ie. perception without awareness, etc.) 
    - Continuous recommendation by AI (rather than me having to constantly find stuff…) 

  - Asking questions to assistant when browsing: 
    ie. give me a similar, QA-questions, show similar stuff, provide annotations or audio/video search, etc.  
      - The extension can automatically be used also to provide further information (similar to some current extensions) on 
      something I am reading, person-extractor, etc. 
    
  - People-blog-SM entity linking: 
    - This would be extremely helpful in general but would be great in recommendation



TODO: Building your own ‘ontology’ 
  - On right click, show 'side-bar' with corresponding features
    - Add categories to my text snippets (each snippet can have a note next to it)
  - In UI:
    - Add linking between snippets as well (whether apart of same category or different)
      - each link can have a note next to it 

  - Add simple search over text snippets
  - Figure out how to add my macOS notes, pdf files as links as well (** this is important)

A: (<— starting here...) 
- “organizing the de-organized web; so much great information but it is so hard to find” 
  (both from passive search and active discovery method) 

- An AI that automatically tracks stuff that you like, whether it be blogs, etc. and starts recommending you articles from those sites, 
or similar articles/domains/people ('discover an interesting website you never knew about')
  - ^ A lot of great information on the web but at the moment, I need to actively find it; there has to exist an AI that finds 
    information for me, based on my search history, daily browsing, bookmarks, etc. 
      - YT recommends videos (although I want to build a better personalized recommendation engine) 
        - ^ Cold start problem can be evaded by using browser history 

- Many additional features can be added beyond the above: 
  - Entity-linking people with all their information on the web (recommendation of people/personal-websites, twitter profiles, etc.)
  - QA on documents, summarization, organization via topics/categories, can provide abstractive overviews of current trends in 
  various topics (to help with information overload problem)
    

Possible approach: 
  - Start with a browser extension that will read my browsing history/bookmarks
    - Use this browsing history for: 
      - Learning the types of content I like and types of websites I spend a lot of time on 
        - Scrape the web accordingly to above... (this set will be adaptive and continue to grow)
          - Then from there, have a webapp that starts to recommend content 
            - Also have a 'subscribe/follow' feature for blogs (need to restrict type) that I really enjoy reading, 
            the AI will send notifications when a new one is posted (can recommend you other blogs as well)
